# ccna-labs

This repository will be filled with GNS3 labs that are strictly designed to help you pass the CCNA Exam. The repository will grow with time, by allowing users to share their own labs and by requests for new labs from users. If there is a particular topic in the CCNA that you want new labs for, please don't hesitate to contact me. ALL labs were created using the c3640-jk9s-mz.124-16.bin and you are REQUIRED to have that. Users are also encouraged to leave comments and feedback about each of the labs.
